## General info
  
  The portfolio created in ReactJS uses most of the previously acquired knowledge and shows new things. All information and data are retrieved from Firebase, where it is also hosted. Several libraries are used to make the website look and work better. Pictures are in the form of .webp to make the page load even faster. All styles are written in scss. While creating, I learned how to better plan the entire process of creating a website from the very beginning. The UI was designed in Figma.
